<h1><strong><u>Artificial Intelligence</u></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> is a growing ideology in today's society and is taking the internet by <br>storm. AI (<em>Artificial Intelligence</em>) has grown to be so much more <strong>sophisticated and complex</strong> <br>over the last <strong>decade</strong>, being able to perform <strong>human tasks that require logic</strong> beyond your average <br>computer's understanding, such as answering custom questions that you have.</p>
<p>The video below explains what Artificial Intelligence is and how it works.</p>

<br>
<p>So we now know <em>what AI is and how it works</em>, but how does it affect our daily lives?</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> poses a threat to our current jobs and <strong>employment in general</strong>. <br>This is because <strong>most jobs can actually be done by machines/AI</strong>, which is what is <br>slowly happening all over the world.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>farming jobs</strong>.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Farming jobs</strong> are becoming <strong>less accessible and endangered</strong> due to the threat of machines taking <br>over the farming industry. As these machines are capable of doing <strong>human tasks</strong>, there is now no <br><em>need</em> for people to do the work, removing the <strong>capability of employment</strong>.</p>
